    Some notes on hyperparameter tuning:
    - Set the external temperature based on conditions during testing/launch.
    - To tune the tank pressure:
        - A higher T_tank_init tends to move the initial tank pressure up.
        - A higher Cd tends to result in a steeper slope.
    - To tune the combustion chamber pressure:
        - A higher Cd tends to move the initial combustion chamber pressure up.
        - A higher dr_thdt tends to result in a steeper slope.
    - To tune the fuel regression rate.
        - Tweak a and n.
        - This data has not been available yet, so beware that these parameters are not tuned.
