# AESIR_Mjollnir_propulsion_simulation
Flight and static fire simulations of NOx/Paraffin Hybrid Rocket

Use main.m to simulate

system_equations.m is the function integrated in the simulation

Models are then devided in the following folders :
* Combustion (tank, injection and combustion chamber)
* Thrust (nozzle and ejection)
* Flight (drag, acceleration and speed)
